# TwitterFinal

I took part in the Python for Web Development Course run by CF:G (Code First Girls) from Feb-April 2019. The course comprised of 8 evening sessions and the content was taught by current computer science students at my university. We covered some Python basics including user inputs, functions, loops and conditional statements. 
There was a competition running alongside the course for which we had to develop our own project. For my project, I designed a Twitter inights tool which outputted a series of insights based on a key word inputted by the user.
